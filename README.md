# SnowLeopardPorts
A local repo of ports configured for 10.6 Snow Leopard and either shadow newer, incompatible versions of ports or are modified to work on Snow Leopard.

Some Portfiles may require the MacOS10.7.sdk to build against. This should be placed in your SDK folder, next to the other SDKs there.
